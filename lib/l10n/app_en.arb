  "warningMessage": "This application is meticulously prepared by 15-year-old young Turkish developers and is currently in internal testing phase. Therefore, the application is not fully ready, and you may encounter obvious errors during use.\n\nDue to the rapid increase of mobile offline AI projects and our progress towards being one of the pioneering projects in this field, we decided to share Vertex AI with our users at an early stage. We are aware of the response inconsistency issue in the local models in this version of the application and are working intensively to resolve these issues.\n\nPlease report any errors you encounter in the application or any suggestions you may have to contribute to our development process by sending an email to the address below. Your feedback is crucial for making the application more stable and user-friendly.\n\nThank you for your understanding and support. Have fun!",
